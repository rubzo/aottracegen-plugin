aottracegen-plugin
==================

A plugin for baksmali that generates AOT traces to be injected 
into the Dalvik JIT compiler. A work in progress.

You need a version of baksmali that can use plugins!
See: https://github.com/rubzo/smali-with-plugins 

Building
========

Edit build.sh to point BAKSMALI_JAR at your built baksmali jar file.
Run ./build.sh
The plugin is called aottracegen-plugin.jar by default.

Typical usage
=============

baksmali -P aottracegen-plugin.jar,eu.whrl.aottracegen.AOTTraceGen,<trace selection file> <.odex file>

Example 'trace selection file' contents
=======================================

app com.eembc.coremark
class Lcom/eembc/coremark/ee_state;
method core_state_transition_switch
signature ([BI[I)Lcom/eembc/coremark/ee_state$CORE_STATE;
trace 0x0
trace 0x1c
trace 0x34

- Putting 'merge' on a single line anywhere in the file will cause the plugin
to merge all the selected traces and emit a single trace from the merge.
